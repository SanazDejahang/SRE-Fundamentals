# SRE Notes

My personal notes while learning Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes to become an SRE.

---

## Topics

1. [System Boot and Processes](./01_system_boot_and_processes.md)
2. [Linux Process Management](./02_linux_process_management.md)
3. [Docker Basics](./03_docker_basics.md)

---

 These notes are written as I learn step by step, focusing on understanding how systems really work under the hood.
